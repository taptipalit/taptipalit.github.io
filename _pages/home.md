I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at Purdue University at the [Reliable and Secure Systems Lab](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pfonseca/). My research interests lie in the intersection of software security, program analysis, and compilers. I'm also interested in the "core" systems areas of operating systems and virtualization.

I successfully defended by Ph.D. thesis in October 2021 at Stony Brook University. As part of my dissertation project, I built a scalable defense against sensitive information leakage. As part of this, I spent a significant part of the years 2019 - 2020, wrestling with pointer analysis techniques, and in particular the [SVF](https://github.com/SVF-tools/SVF) pointer analysis library. I wrote up my findings in these blog posts [here](https://tpalitblog.wordpress.com/pointer-analysis-notes/).

I'm always looking for exciting opportunities in program analysis and compilers!
