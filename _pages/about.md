I'm an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Davis. 
My research aims to improve software security and system performance by leveraging novel insights in the
software security, program analysis, and systems domains.

Prior to joining UC Davis, I was a CRA Computing Innovation Fellow at Purdue University where
I worked with [Dr. Pedro
Fonseca](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pfonseca/) in the Reliable and Secure Systems Lab.
Before that, I was a Ph.D student at Stony Brook University at the HexLab, led by 
[Dr. Michalis Polychronakis](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mikepo/).

My Google Scholar page is [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lJqQKlQAAAAJ).
My CV is [here](assets/pdf/CV_Tapti.pdf).
