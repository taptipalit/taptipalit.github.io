I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at Purdue University at the Reliable and Secure Systems Lab, where
I work under the guidance of [Dr. Pedro
Fonseca](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pfonseca/).
My research interests lie in the intersection of software security, systems, and program analysis.

Before joining Purdue, I completed my Ph.D. at Stony Brook University, where I
conducted research on protecting sensitive user data against data leakage, under the guidance of
[Dr. Michalis Polychronakis](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mikepo/).
